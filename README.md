# WGUPS-Routing-Program

The WGUPS Routing Program uses a nearest neighbor search algorithm within the code of the min_distance_from_address function. The function compares the distance from the delivery truckâ€™s current address to the addresses of all packages within the delivery truck using the distance_between function and selects the package with the shortest distance.
